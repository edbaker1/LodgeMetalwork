               </p>
               <p class="homepage-maintext">
                    Hi, my name is Ed and I'm a student studying Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at the University of Bath. I have two more years left
                    and in September I will be going into my 3rd year. My late Grandad taught me to weld and I've loved doing it ever since.
                    I'm now hoping to use what he has taught me to help fund my final couple of years at University. I am also a competitive track cyclist competing at an international level
                    with the aim of hopefully being selected for Team GB and compete at the LA Olympics.
               </p>

                    What I Offer

                <div class="homepage-maintext">
                    Everything that I make I make by hand and in my spare time when I'm not studying or training. On the Products page you will find products that I currently make and are 
                    available to order. On the portfolio page
                    are images of products that I have previously made and would be more than happy to quote a price to make again. If there is 
                    something that you can't find on either the product page or portfolio page but would still be interested in having it made then please
                    don't hesitate to send me an email, it could be anything from garden furniture to fences.
